# Data Structures Collection

A comprehensive collection of data structures implemented in C#/.NET, designed with performance, type safety, and modern programming practices in mind.

## Projects

### Generic Search

Implementation of common search algorithms with both synchronous and asynchronous support. [Learn more](./GenericSearch/README.md)

- Binary Search (O(log n))
- Linear Search (O(n))
- Generic implementation
- Async/await support
- Iterative and recursive approaches

## Features

- Modern C# implementations
- Full documentation and examples
- Unit test coverage
- Performance benchmarks
- Generic type support
- Thread-safe implementations where applicable

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohammadnazarkhani/DataStructures.git
cd DataStructures
```

Each project can be built independently:

```bash
cd GenericSearch
dotnet build
```

## Requirements

- .NET 8.0 or later
- Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code

## Contributing
